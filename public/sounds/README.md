# Sound Files

This directory contains sound files used in the application:

- `notification.mp3`: Sound played when a notification is received
- `error.mp3`: Sound played when an error occurs
- `click.mp3`: Sound played when a button is clicked
- `complete.mp3`: Sound played when a task is completed

These files are empty placeholders. Replace them with actual sound files for production use.
